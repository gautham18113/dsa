    "Dynamic Programming is similar to divide and conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It breaks down problems into disjoint sub-problems, solves the sub-problems and combines the result of these sub-problems to solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is useful when the sub-problems **share** sub-sub-problems. It stores the result of sub-sub-problems that have already been solved into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is faster than divide and conquer.\n",

    "Dynamic Programming is typically used to solve **optimization problems**, where there can be multiple possible solutions and each solution has a value. We want to find an optimal (minimum or maximum) value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar pattern in DP problems is that there is usually a set of choices (to take, or not to take for ex.) at each sub-problem, which will yield multiple sub-sub-problems."
