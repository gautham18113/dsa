    "# Self Balancing BST\n",
    "\n",
    "A self-balancing binary tree remains balanced after every insertion or deletion. Several decades of research has gone into creating self-balancing binary trees, and many approaches have been devised e.g. B-trees, Red Black Trees and AVL (Adelson-Velsky Landis) trees.\n",

    "## Adelson-Velsky Landis (AVL) Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "An AVL tree is a self balancing tree that re-adjusts itself during every insert to make sure that it is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a `balance factor` to determine if a node is balanced or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `balance factor` can have values of 0, 1 or -1. Any other value means that the node is unbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 cases of imbalance possible during insertion -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left of Left (LL) Imbalance**\n",
    "\n",
    "![LL.png](../static/LL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left of Right (LR) Imbalance**\n",
    "![LR.png](../static/self-balancing-bst-lr-imbalance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right of Right (RR) Imbalance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to LL, but on the right side. Should be rotated anti-clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![RR.png](../static/RR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right of Left (RL) Imbalance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AVL only works on three nodes at a time, regardless of the size of the tree, whenever there is an imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalance is resolved from bottom up.\n",
